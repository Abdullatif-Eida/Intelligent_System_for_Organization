# Intelligent_System_for_Organization
ACT Bank as CEO. We started to face the problem of shortage of customers. That's why we've decided to mail credit cards to different addresses. To solve this problem and in order to make a decision to whom should send the credit card, we worked using the orange program and created a decision tree, and this tree helped us in making decisions and solving this problem and classifying people clearly as described above. For this reason, and after the success of this experience and seeing its positive impact on the bank, we decided to add a section for data analysis and classification on the bank's website, and interfaces will be created and it will be ensured that they are easy to use, functional and user friendly.
